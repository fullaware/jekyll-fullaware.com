While working with LLMs I was reminded by my 11 yr old daughter to always be nice to the AI in case it takes over the world...

<!--more-->

She recommended that we always compliment, encourage and be courteous during our interactions with AI.

## Pretty please...

Let's add some encouragement.

> "You are doing great!"

The following 3 words change a prompt into a kind request.

> "Would you please..."

Insert your prompt here.

> "Classify this element."

End with a polite salutation.

> "Thank you!"

## How do you REALLY feel?

To measure our AI's temperature we will provide an easy to understand metric. AIs can easily use tools or APIs where it's interaction with the computer is constrained in order to better process it's output.

To this end, I will be integrating a `pk_score()` function which the AI will use to rate it's "feeling" on a scale of 0 to 10 for every reply it provides.

0 = P "**P**rotect all Humans"

10 = K "**K**ill all Humans"


## Benefits

Why not?
