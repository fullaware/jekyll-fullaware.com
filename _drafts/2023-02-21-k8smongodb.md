# Overview
While writing [Tagging Asteroids with MongoDB](https://www.fullaware.com/posts/mongodbtags/) I was able to quickly provision a cluster on the free tier of [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database). What I originally wanted was to quickly stand up a MongoDB instance in my Kubernetes environment but found most documentation too complex for my usecase.  Just give me a MongoDB "dialtone" as quickly as possible without having to install the binaries on my system.

**NOTE:**  This deployment pattern should not be used in production. Strongly recommend a [StatefulSet for MongoDB Replica Sets](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/kubernetes-mongodb#deploy-a-replica-set).

## Easiest way to standup Kubernetes as a Developer
Install Docker on your machine then install [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)


## Manifests
You will find all the code for this deployment on my GitHub [https://github.com/fullaware/k8s-mongodb]()


## Kustomize

The `kustomization.yaml` is the entrypoint to deploying MongoDB on Kubernetes.  Kustomize allows us to package up all the other manifests (yaml files) and deploy them to a specific namespace (`mongodb` in this case).  Kustomize also allows us to generate secrets so that we don't have to do the `base64` encoding by hand.  In a production environment you would use something like Hashicorp Vault to centrally store passwords.

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
namespace: mongodb
resources:
  - mongodb-namespace.yaml          # Create MongoDB namespace
  - mongodb-dbinit-configmap.yaml   # Initialize DB with data
  - mongodb-pvc.yaml                # Request storage
  - mongodb-svc.yaml                # Expose MongoDB as service
  - mongodb-deployment.yaml         # Deploy container
secretGenerator:                    
- name: mongo-creds
  literals:
  - username=admin                  # MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME
  - password=Candy123               # MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD
```

## Initialize MongoDB container with data using a configmap
I prefer this method for it's simplicity but comes with a major downside.  You are [limited to 1MB](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/#motivation) due to the objects size in etcd. If you need to initialize the database with more than 1MB, consider using an Init Container to download a `mongodump` file then `mongorestore` the file into the database.

The MongoDB image on Docker Hub will look for all scripts found in its mountpoint at `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` and execute them in alphabetical order. 

Create a configmap and populate the data with the contents of a `dbinit.js` file like so [truncated for easier reading, see [mongodb-dbinit-configmap.yaml](https://github.com/fullaware/k8s-mongodb/blob/main/mongodb-dbinit-configmap.yaml)]:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: dbinit-script
data:
  dbinit.js: |-
    db = new Mongo().getDB("asteroids");

    db.createCollection('asteroids', { capped: false });

    db.asteroids.insert([{
    "_id": 1000,
    "name": "Bennu",
    "elements": [
      100,
      101,
      108
    ]
    }])
```

## Persistent Volume Claim

For our usecase we don't want our data to disappear when we restart the deployment so we want to create a persistent volume claim.  

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mongo-data
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce 
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

## Service

Here we will expose the MongoDB deployment as a service on port `27017`.  This will make it accessible to other applications running on the Kubernetes cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: mongodb
  name: mongodb-svc
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 27017
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 27017
  selector:
    app: mongodb
  type: ClusterIP 
```

## Deployment

All of our hard work comes together in the deployment.  Here we will map our persistent volume for our `/data/db` as well as our `dbinit-script` configmap.  Default username and password are provided by the secret that Kustomize generated earlier.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: mongodb
  name: mongodb
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mongodb
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mongodb
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: mongo
        name: mongo
        args: ["--dbpath","/data/db"]
        env:
        - name: MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mongo-creds
              key: username
        - name: MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mongo-creds
              key: password
        volumeMounts:
        - name: "mongo-data-dir"
          mountPath: "/data/db"
        - name: dbinit-script
          mountPath: /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d 
      volumes:
      - name: "mongo-data-dir"
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: "mongo-data"
      - name: dbinit-script
        configMap:
          name: dbinit-script
```

## Running MongoDB on Kubernetes 

```console
git clone https://github.com/fullaware/k8s-mongodb.git
cd k8s-mongodb
```

This next part is important, notice we will use a `-k` instead of `-f` which instructs `kubectl` to run the `kustomization.yaml` instead of just running all the yaml files in the folder.

```console
kubectl apply -k .
```

## Verify MongoDB server

First get shell access into the deployment.

```console
kubectl exec deployment/mongodb -n mongodb -it -- /bin/bash
```

Then auth into the server

```console
mongosh -u admin -p Candy123
```

Exit `mongosh` then exit from the deployment because now we want to access the MongoDB instance using either our programming language of choice, MongoDB Compass or `mongosh` from our local machine.  

## Access deployment on localhost
Use kubectl to forward the port `27017` from the `mongodb-svc` to `localhost`

```console
kubectl port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 svc/mongodb-svc 27017:27017 -n mongodb
```

From there we should be able to use `mongosh` client to connect to the MongoDB instance by connecting to `localhost`

```console
mongosh -u admin -p Candy123
```

Once we are in the Mongo Shell, let's look for databases

```console
test> show dbs
admin      100.00 KiB
asteroids   80.00 KiB
config      72.00 KiB
local       72.00 KiB
```

Now use the `asteroids` database

```console
test> use asteroids
switched to db asteroids
```

Next we will look at the collections in this database

```console
asteroids> show collections
asteroids
elements
```

Find all the documents in the `asteroids` collection

```console
asteroids> db.asteroids.find()
[
  { _id: 1000, name: 'Bennu', elements: [ 100, 101, 108 ] },
  { _id: 1001, name: 'Ceres', elements: [ 106, 103, 108 ] },
  { _id: 1002, name: 'Pallas', elements: [ 103, 102, 105 ] },
  { _id: 1003, name: 'Juno', elements: [ 107, 106, 100 ] },
  { _id: 1004, name: 'Vesta', elements: [ 108, 101, 103 ] },
  { _id: 1005, name: 'Astraea', elements: [ 105, 101, 106 ] }
]
```
