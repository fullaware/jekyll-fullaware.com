Let's be honest, nothing is going to sell the general public on asteroid mining like landing a 10,000kg chunk of space gold on this planet.

958524 asteroids in our solarsystem.

119 elements in the periodic table.

5 of those elements are valued commodities;

- [platinum](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PL%3DF/)
- [copper](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HG%3DF/)
- [palladium](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PA%3DF/)
